Although most of my interaction I had in mind are game inspired. I do want to try and make an interaction with the mouse. My second idea was to explore more on the interactions provided. Making a button where the circle would change color as well as movements. Then there would be a secret button to make the circle disappear and unable to interact. The main goal for this idea was to explore more on the coding for interactions same as the first one. There will not be any sound given to this or there will be one. I have not decided on this complete idea.
