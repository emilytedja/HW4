My first idea for this project was to make a simple game. It is a space invader type of game and it has the same kind of interactions without the graphic but with simple circles and tries to dodge and destroy it. There would be scores depending on the size of the circles defeated. I want to try to recreate this interaction with the code. If it is not achieved to that standard then I would try to recreate the space ship movement without a target. I want to create that “W, A, S, D” movement as the main goal of this project as well as the shooting sound and bullet that would come out.
